It is a natural process for animal species to become extinct (e.g. Dinosaur, dodos …) There is no reason why people should try to prevent this from happening. Do you agree or disagree?
**Assignment
Certain individuals hold the belief that there are no compelling reasons for us to protect animal species from extinction as it occurs naturally. I dissent with this conviction and will support my argument in the essay below.
It is true that millions of years ago, many ancient species of animals, such as dinosaurs, were wiped out due to a gradual shift in climate and changing sea levels, according to some hypotheses. However, these environmental factors are not the primary contributor to the disappearance of certain species nowadays. Industrial activities have been devastating the natural habitats of wildlife and disturbing the food chain, causing the mass extinction  of countless species. The increased demand for goods made from animals’ products, such as skins and horns, also leads to the rampant poaching of wild, endangered animals, rhinos for instance. In this regard, humans are held accountable and should do what is needed to rectify the situation.
Other justifications  for saving wild animals involve  the significant roles that they play in not only the balance of the ecosystem but also our lives. Everything in nature is connected , and if one species becomes extinct, many other animals and even plants will suffer as the food chain is disrupted. Wild animals also have great aesthetic and socio-cultural values. They contribute to our rich bio-diversity  that makes this planet a beautiful place. In numerous places around the world, many types of animals play an important role in different cultures. For example, in some religions, cows are revered and worshiped as gods.
The disappearance of many animal species does not always occur as a natural process but as a consequence of our doings . It is our obligation to help preserve wild animals because their extinction will have a severe influence on many important aspects of our lives.

**Vocabulary and Grammar Enhancement
- some people believe-> certain individuals hold the belief
Explanation: Replacing "some people believe" with "certain individuals hold the belief" elevates the language by using more formal terminology and avoids the use of colloquial language.
- the mass extinction-> the widespread extinction
Explanation: Replacing "the mass extinction" with "the widespread extinction" offers a more precise term that aligns better with academic language.
- Other justifications-> Additional rationales
Explanation: "Other justifications" can be replaced with "Additional rationales" to enhance the formality and specificity of the language.
- involve-> include
Explanation: Substituting "involve" with "include" provides a more formal and precise term that fits academic writing conventions.
- Everything in nature is connected-> The interconnectedness of nature
Explanation: Rewording "Everything in nature is connected" to "The interconnectedness of nature" maintains the meaning while using more sophisticated language.
- rich bio-diversity-> rich biodiversity
Explanation: "Bio-diversity" can be corrected to "biodiversity" to adhere to standard spelling conventions in academic writing.
- does not always occur as a natural process but as a consequence of our doings-> does not always result from natural processes but from human actions
Explanation: The phrase "as a consequence of our doings" can be replaced with "from human actions" to convey the same meaning in a more formal manner.

**Strengthening the Argument
- Introduction: "Some people believe that there are no compelling reasons for us to protect animal species from extinction as it occurs naturally. I personally disagree with this conviction and will support my argument in the essay below.
    +	Explanation: The introduction clearly states the writer's position on the issue and sets the stage for the discussion to follow.
    +	Improved Example: "While some argue that the natural extinction of animal species is a necessary part of evolution, I firmly believe that we have a moral and ethical obligation to protect these species from extinction. This essay will explore the reasons why preventing animal extinction is not only important for the preservation of biodiversity but also for the well-being of our planet and future generations."
-	Main Point 1: "It is true that millions of years ago, many ancient species of animals, such as dinosaurs, were wiped out due to a gradual shift in climate and changing sea levels, according to some hypotheses. However, these environmental factors are not the primary contributor to the disappearance of certain species nowadays. Industrial activities have been devastating the natural habitats of wildlife and disturbing the food chain, causing the mass extinction of countless species.
    +	Explanation: This point effectively highlights the role of human activities in the current extinction crisis.
    +	Improved Example: "While it is true that natural factors such as climate change and sea level rise have contributed to the extinction of species in the past, the current extinction crisis is primarily driven by human activities. The destruction of natural habitats, pollution, and climate change have disrupted ecosystems and endangered countless species."
-	Main Point 2: "The increased demand for goods made from animals’ products, such as skins and horns, also leads to the rampant poaching of wild, endangered animals, rhinos for instance. In this regard, humans are held accountable and should do what is needed to rectify the situation.
    +	Explanation: This point effectively addresses the role of human consumption in the extinction of certain species.
    +	Improved Example: "The demand for animal products such as meat, fur, and ivory has led to rampant poaching and the exploitation of endangered species. The illegal wildlife trade is a major contributor to the extinction of many species, and it is our responsibility to curb this trade and protect these animals."
-	Main Point 3: "Other justifications for saving wild animals involve the significant roles that they play in not only the balance of the ecosystem but also our lives. Everything in nature is connected, and if one species becomes extinct, many other animals and even plants will suffer as the food chain is disrupted. Wild animals also have great aesthetic and socio-cultural values. They contribute to our rich bio-diversity that makes this planet a beautiful place. In numerous places around the world, many types of animals play an important role in different cultures. For example, in some religions, cows are revered and worshiped as gods.
    +	Explanation: This point effectively highlights the ecological and cultural significance of wild animals.
    +	Improved Example: "Wild animals play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of ecosystems. They are essential for pollination, seed dispersal, and nutrient cycling. The loss of even a single species can have a ripple effect on the entire ecosystem. Additionally, wild animals have cultural and aesthetic value. They inspire art, literature, and spiritual practices. The extinction of these animals would be a loss to humanity's cultural heritage."
-	Conclusion: "The disappearance of many animal species does not always occur as a natural process but as a consequence of our doings. It is our obligation to help preserve wild animals because their extinction will have a severe influence on many important aspects of our lives.
    +	Explanation: The conclusion effectively summarizes the main arguments and reiterates the writer's position.
    +	Improved Example: "In conclusion, while natural factors may have contributed to the extinction of species in the past, the current extinction crisis is primarily driven by human activities. It is our responsibility to protect these animals and their habitats. The loss of biodiversity, the disruption of ecosystems, and the cultural significance of wild animals make it imperative that we take action to prevent animal extinction."
Overall, the essay provides a well-reasoned and persuasive argument against the idea that animal species should be allowed to go extinct naturally. The writer effectively highlights the role of human activities in the current extinction crisis and the ecological, cultural, and ethical significance of wild animals.

  Scientists and news media are presenting ever more evidence of climate change. Governments cannot expected to solve this problem. It is the responsibility of individuals to change their lifestyles prevent further damage. What are your views?

    """Recently scientists worried climate change have urged governments to introduce measures to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that are seen as its main cause. Simultaneously, politicians and environmentalists urged individuals to make changes to their lifestyles. I shall argue that governments and individuals should join responsibility for this problem. 

Firstly, industry for a large proportion of greenhouse gas emissions, and this can only be controlled by government action. Measures could taken to discourage pollution, such as limiting or taxing the use of fossil fuels. Alternatively, subsidies could offered to industries to clean up their production processes. If these were adopted, I believe that businesses would regard pollution as a financial issue. 

Secondly, the discussion between governments can ensure that solutions are successful. The Kyoto agreement, example, tried to reach a global agreement on how to address the problem. Without such operating, it seems to me that efforts to reduce fuel consumption are unlikely to be effective. 

However, national international policies will only succeed if individuals also change their lifestyles. For example, could think more carefully about how they use energy in their homes. By using less electricity, installing efficient light bulbs and electrical appliances, or investing in solar panels, individuals can make a real difference. In addition, I think individual attitudes to transport need change. Instead of making trips by car, people could choose to walk, cycle, or take a bus. Since cars a major source of the problem, changing our behavior in this area would have a major impact. In conclusion, I would maintain only a combination of an international agreement, national policies, and changes in individual behavior will succeed in preventing further damage to the environment."""
